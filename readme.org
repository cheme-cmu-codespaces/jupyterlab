#+title: Jupyterlab in Codespaces

[[./jupyter-in-the-cloud.png]]

This has a lot of batteries included. I include kernels for Python, Julia, R and Racket. I guess you would not want all of these in a typical project. This repo illustrates what is possible.

I have not thoroughly tested all of these.

* Python

The Python kernel supports a lot of packages. It is based off of Anaconda which already provides a lot of features, and I have added quite a few more on top of that. 

I have made it possible to export your notebooks to PDF via LaTeX and via webpdf.

* Julia

This is a pretty minimal Julia environment. It includes Plots and ForwardDiff.

* R

I include a very minimal R environment. It is mostly a demonstration that you can run R in a Codespace.

* Racket

I include a minimal Racket environment as a demonstration of running Racket in a Codespace.
